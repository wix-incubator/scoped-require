## What is scoped-require?

scoped-require enables you to designate a directory as a "firewalled" directory - requires from this base directory
will be firewalled into that directory and will not be allowed to escape.
This means that require-ing a module external to that directory will fail.

Why would anyone use it? For user-code, that you want to run under your node program, but don't want them
to use your modules and your code.

The module also enables you to re-import everything under that folder, to enable a use-case where the user
changes something in the module and wants to reload it, without restarting your application.
This can be done automatically, on every require, so that you can `require` the user code, and the user can edit it
while knowing that her change will automatically be reloaded next time you `require`.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save scoped-require
```


## Usage

```js
var scopedRequire = require('scoped-require');

var baseModule = scopedRequire(['dir-with-module']);

var aModule = baseModule.require('a-module');

// use module...

baseModule.clearCache();

// reload module
aModule = baseModule.require('a-module');

```

Note thate creating the "scoped require" needs to be done after any other hooks to require,
e.g. Traceur, babel, and others. This is because other hooks may not execute the original hook,
but will rather override them.

## Reference API
```js
var scopedRequire = require('scoped-require');
```

The module exposes a factory returning a base module -

### `scopedRequire(scopedDirs, /*optional*/options)`:
The parameters are:
* `scopedDirs`: an array of directories (full or relative paths. If relative, they are relative to cwd).
These directories are the search path - any scoped require will search these directories, in the order they were given.
* `options`: an object with the following (optional) fields.
  * `autoDeleteCache`: every time `require` (see below) is called, it will also delete the cache, so that the
  next time `require` is called, the module will reload. Default: false.

Returns an object with the following method:
* `require`: use this require to require any module which is in one of the `scopedDirs`
* `loadCodeAsModule(content, filename)`: use this as an alternative to require, to load code that is dynamic.
* `scopedDirs`: same array passed as an argument. If the dirs were relative, then this array will contain the absolute paths.
the `filename` is to make the errrors make sense.
* `clearCache(directoriesToClear)`: a method, that if called, will clear the module cache of all the modules
already loaded from the `scopedDirs`. require-ing them again will reload them.
Accepts an optional `directoriesToClear` array of strings argument. If given, `clearCache` will only clear modules inside the given directories from the cache.
